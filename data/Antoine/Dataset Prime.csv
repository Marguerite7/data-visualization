In a time when the barriers of sexual morality and social convention have been broken down, Kay, Helen, Viv and Duncan enjoy a freedom never experienced before.  Moving back in time through the 1940s into the maelstrom of the Blitz, the lives, loves and losses of these four central characters are unravelled. For them, the post-war victory is bittersweet, for it returns them to the margins of society, from which they hoped they had been liberated. In order to build their future they must each make peace with their past.;Love and liberation in wartime;DeWMFKomkzg;/7ayMrUTmt9FIqIOLrLZrlpWBFDX.jpg;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/7ayMrUTmt9FIqIOLrLZrlpWBFDX.jpg;14;False;False;True;False;

On Halloween, investigators arrested three men on charges of having sex with teenage boys. The investigators claimed the arrests were just the tip of the iceberg-they said hundreds of boys were being abused as part of a child sex ring. There was no such ring, but the result was a widespread investigation which some people consider a witch hunt. By the time the investigation ended, 16 men were charged. Countless other lives were also touched.In some cases, men implicated fled the area. At least one actually left the country. The investigation attracted attention in newspapers across the nation, including Time Magazine. The ""Morals Drive"" left scars which remain to this day.";;;/9FdS3ZRpHthZH79rjFIR1k3DS0L.jpg;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/9FdS3ZRpHthZH79rjFIR1k3DS0L.jpg;-1;False;False;True;False;

When few thought it possible, then-Captain Rickover harnessed the power of the atom to drive the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, whose trip under the polar ice pack was one of the great adventure stories of the 1950s. Later, Rickover built the world's first nuclear aircraft carrier and the first commercial nuclear power plant at Shippingport, PA. Rickover's achievements made him into a national celebrity, and he appeared on the cover of Time magazine.  Many wonder whether America can maintain its technological pre-eminence and whether we can still build and manage large-scale projects.

Meeting at a weekly coffee klatch for the local over-70 set (no girls allowed!), three ""old goats"" from different social strata develop an unlikely friendship. One's a married, golf-playing, sports-car-driving businessman recently forced into retirement. Another is a salty octogenarian World War II vet and (still) devoted womanizer. The third is a shy bachelor car mechanic, just fired, who lives on a squalid sailboat . Theirs is the common tragedy of losing one's vocation, one's purpose in life. There's talk of sailing adventures, online dating, and a condo in Palm Springs, but these three live in common terror of the question, ""What's next for you?"" They know damn well what's next! And they're determined to avoid it for as long as possible.";;;/7ds83fdsX7aeHUSrpCDbZ1xOuEq.jpg;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/7ds83fdsX7aeHUSrpCDbZ1xOuEq.jpg;-1;False;False;True;False;

Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property examines how the story of Turner’s revolt has been interpreted throughout history and how it continues to raise new questions about the nature of terrorism and other forms of violent resistance to oppression.  The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner’s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history’s most mysterious figures.;;;/5QadxGqotnDX36KqV12tH1mvxZk.jpg;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/5QadxGqotnDX36KqV12tH1mvxZk.jpg;7;False;False;True;False;

The Isle of Man TT is the most dangerous motorcycle race in the world. Over 230 people have died trying to conquer the 37 3/4 mile circuit, regarded as the ultimate thrill ride for any racer. On June 7th 2000, pub landlord and supremo of road racing Joey Dunlop won this race for a staggering 26th time.

This is the incredible story of how one determined middle aged man of almost 50 years old beat the odds, only to be cut down in tragic circumstances.

Of the 600 inmates present on the day of the escape, 300 escaped into the forest surrounding Sobibor. Of that 300, many were shot, turned in, murdered, or captured by Nazis. Around 50 survived the war and of that 50, only a handful are still alive.
